# OneNote Sticky
The purpose of this project is to develop an application of Sticky Notes with OneNote synchronization (and possibly in the future with other cloud notes platforms).

This application is being developed with the following tools / technologies feature:
- Visual Studio 2013
- C# .NET 4.5
- WPF
- MVVM
- RestSharp (For HTTP requests and POCO)
- OneNote API
- Live Connect API

---

**Bottom line:**
I'm a novice with MVVM, WPF and POCO, so if someone is interested in the project, it is welcome to collaborate in the development.

That's it ☺️
